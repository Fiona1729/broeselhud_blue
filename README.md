A fork of BroeselHUD Blue with backgrounds from Alena Aenami - https://www.artstation.com/aenamiart

I made this to add some custom backgrounds to my HUD from an artist I really liked, and got enough of a positive response that I figured I'd upload it.

## Usage

If you're just using the existing HUD with 1080p, you don't need to do anything. If you're running 1440p, drag the materials folder out of the 1440p folder and move it into the main HUD folder. If it asks you to replace a bunch of VTFs you're doing it right.

Also provided for convenience are the backgrounds and background script alone in VTF form. If you're running these with a custom HUD, you may want to edit the mainmenuoverride.res file in /resource/ui to remove any holiday/event override backgrounds, and of course rename them to remove the "disabled"

Enjoy.
